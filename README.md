# Mohammad-s-lab

This directory is a modified version of https://github.com/open2jamorg/open2jam with ojm file from http://o2jam.intgamerz.net/index.php?p=songpack (song pack 1). 

This directory is for other other lab members to be able to download the files easily and modify the file in the further future. 

In order to run the program, you cd to /dist and run java -jar open2jam.jar (java is required. For Mac, you need java 6 not the latest one).

After you run the program, you have to choose the right directory for the music. I put some official music and boring mad moon sonata (3 notes ver). The official one is in SP1. Boring mad moon sonata can be found in Mad Moon sonata.

NoteTool can be used for modifying the notes.
