/render/lwjgl/LWJGLGameWindow.java
	An implementation of GameWindow that will use OPENGL (JOGL) to 
 * render the scene. Its also responsible for monitoring the keyboard
 * using AWT.

/render/ResourceFactory
A central reference point for creating resources for use in the game. The resources
 * return may be implemented in several different rendering contexts but will also 
 * work within the GameWindow supplied from this class. For instance, a Sprite retrieved
 * as a resource will draw happily in the GameWindow supplied from this factory
