constants:
	measure length is 385 pixels at 1x hi-speed
	note speed is 1 measure per second at 240 bpm

then:
measure length at hispeed x = 385*x pixels

note speed at bpm x = x/240 measures per second


* when we say 'x measures per second' that means the note
is going to take x seconds to pass through the measure length.
