We have a list of events, each event has a measure position,

we have the bpm, and the hi-speed

a constant EVENTS_TO_BUFFER, which tells us how much events we should buffer

the measure_size, defined as 385*x pixels where x is the hi-speed.

a variable last_measure , records which was the last measure.

a variable last_measure_offset records where the last measure ends in the chart.

a variable fractional_measure which is 1 unless in the measure where the channel 0 is used.

each frame we do this:

	get the time elapsed since last frame: delta  in milliseconds( or nanoseconds ?)

	if (EVENTS_IN_BUFFER < EVENTS_TO_BUFFER) get all events from last_measure+1 in the list of events.
	else exit

	the absolute position(height) of the event is defined as:

		absolute_height = last_measure_offset + (note_position * measure_size) + 1

	events are made into entities and translated to the screen

		screen_height = viewport_height - absolute_height
		screen_width = #TODO#

	entities position is updated with delta.

		y_move = ((bpm/240) * measure_size) * (delta/1000)


	draw the entities on the screen area

	last_measure++

	last_measure_offset += measure_size * fractional_measure
end frame
